# Rosalind #

This repo has Korflab solutions to Rosalind bioinformatics programming challenges.

## Instructions ##

Add your solution to each subdirectory using the name of the program and your name or initials. For example, in the `DNA` directory, create a file called `dna_ian.pl` if your name is Ian and your solved this in Perl. Additionally, if you provide more than one solution, you can name these as `dna_ian1.pl` and `dna_ian2.pl`. See the `README.md` within each directory for general notes about the solution. At some point, we should collect performance stats on each solution, which includes not just the running time and memory, but how long it takes to write and debug the code.

## Languages ##

Try to solve each programming challenge in every language that's on your CV/resum√©.
