Add your solution to each subdirectory using the name of the program and your name or initials. For example, in the `DNA` directory, create a file called `dna_ian.pl` if your name is Ian and your solved this in Perl. Additionally, if you provide more than one solution, you can name these as `dna_ian1.pl` and `dna_ian2.pl`. Use the `README.md` within each directory if you want to note something of general interest.
